# Data-Communication---Stop-and-Wait-ARQ
Program to implement stop and wait ARQ in noisy channel. The sender should send data and start a timer for it. If it receives acknowledgment, it should stop timer and send the next frame. If it does not receive acknowledgment before the timer times out, it should retransmit the previous frame and start the timer for it. The receiver should send acknowledgment only if it receives the expected frame successfully.
